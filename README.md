Special Recognition: Ahmad Mousa is as passionate and caring as he is knowledgeable, and Joshua Steier never hesitates to help walk us through challenges. 

I always do participate in office hours and study groups while working on projects with collaborators including but not necessarily limited to the following peers: Ilknur Sekmen, Justin Ibeh, Karson Kosek, Kiara Shannon, Luisa Dinwiddie, Margo Berry, Morgan Escue, Morgan Foge, Nathan Johnson, William Brewer, Andrew Clifft, Angela Reed, and Josh Gibson; however, the AskBCS Learning Assistants remain my primary resource when I do get stuck. For the most part, this challenge was more accessible to me, but I did spend my time in stackoverflow.com, w3schools.com, geeksforgeeks.com, github.com, and plotly.com.
